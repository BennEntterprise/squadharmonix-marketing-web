# Squad Harmonix

The Squad brand is one that works with young talented artists.

- Squad Academy is a place where individuals can get access to lessons and be part
  of a larger ensemble.
- Squad Harmonix is the upper echelon of those ensembles and are managed and will
  have their own album that is produced.
- Laura Jean Academy is a place where the student can get even more attention
  with the director of Harmonix and Academy.

# About the Project

The front end is built using React, scaffolded from the [Create-React-App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) utility
with a typescript template and NOT yet ejected. The backend is written on
Node/Express.js (without typescript). Currently this is a marketing/presentation
site and so the express server is very slim with only the routes required to
serve the static files.

Later on Squad would like to control the hero/announcement section of the app
so this will require additional work on the back end, but for all intents and
purposes the backend can be left alone at this time. (They also mentioned the
ability to pull in a twitter feed which will require a twitter api integration.)

Additionally you should be familiar with the Bootstrap Layout Scheme as it is
implemented via the [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
abstraction.
